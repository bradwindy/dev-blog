What if your best practices didn't just live in wikis—what if they were executable? That's the premise behind Claude Code skills.

## The Problem with Documentation

Most best practices are write-only. Someone documents a workflow, it sits in Confluence, and developers either don't find it or don't follow it.

TDD is a perfect example. Everyone agrees it's valuable. Few teams actually practice it consistently. The knowledge exists; the discipline doesn't.

## Skills as Executable Specs

Claude Code skills are markdown files that Claude follows as instructions. Here's the structure:

```markdown
---
name: test-driven-development
description: Use when implementing features or bugfixes
---

# Test-Driven Development

## The Iron Law

**NO IMPLEMENTATION WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST.**

## Workflow

1. Write a test that fails
2. Run it to prove it fails
3. Write minimal code to pass
4. Run tests to prove they pass
5. Refactor if needed
6. Commit
```

When you invoke `/tdd`, Claude follows this exactly. No shortcuts, no rationalization.

## The Iron Law Pattern

The most important pattern: **NO X WITHOUT Y FIRST.**

- No implementation without a failing test
- No merge without passing CI
- No feature without a plan

This language creates a hard decision gate. It's not "try to write tests first"—it's a non-negotiable prerequisite.

<Callout type="tip">
Frame constraints as laws, not suggestions. "NO X WITHOUT Y" is more effective than "consider doing Y before X."
</Callout>

## Description Matters More Than You Think

Skill descriptions determine when Claude uses them. A critical discovery:

**Bad description:**
> "Skill for test-driven development that ensures tests are written before implementation using the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle."

This summarizes the workflow. Claude reads the summary and thinks it understands the skill without reading the full content.

**Good description:**
> "Use when implementing features or bugfixes, before writing implementation code."

This specifies *when* to use the skill, not *what* it does. Claude must read the full skill to understand the workflow.

## Skill Composition

Skills can reference other skills:

```markdown
## After Implementation

Use @requesting-code-review to verify your work before merging.
```

This creates workflows that chain naturally:
1. `/brainstorm` → Define what to build
2. `/write-plan` → Plan implementation
3. `/tdd` → Implement with tests
4. `/code-review` → Verify quality
5. `/finish-branch` → Clean up and merge

## What I've Encoded

Fourteen skills covering:
- **Brainstorming**: Socratic design refinement before coding
- **Writing plans**: 3-phase context gathering before planning
- **TDD**: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR enforcement
- **Debugging**: 4-phase systematic investigation
- **Code review**: Two-stage (spec compliance, then quality)
- **Git worktrees**: Isolated development environments

Each captures hard-won workflow knowledge that would otherwise live in my head.

## The Surprising Benefit

Skills aren't just for AI. Writing them clarified my own processes.

"How do I actually debug?" became a documented 4-phase system. "What makes a good code review?" became a checklist with specific criteria.

The act of encoding forces precision.

## Should You Write Skills?

If you:
- Have workflows you want followed consistently
- Onboard new team members regularly
- Find yourself explaining the same process repeatedly
- Want AI assistance that follows your standards

Then yes. Start with one workflow you care about. Make it executable.

Skills are living documents. Start simple, iterate based on what Claude gets wrong.

## Getting Started

Clone the hyperpowers template:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bradleywilson/hyperpowers
```

Create a skill in `skills/your-workflow/SKILL.md`. Install it as a Claude Code plugin.

Your best practices are now executable.
