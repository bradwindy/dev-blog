Welcome to my developer blog! This is where I'll share my thoughts on software development, tutorials, and more.

<Callout type="tip">

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Tutorials** - Step-by-step guides on various technologies
- **Deep Dives** - In-depth exploration of technical topics
- **Quick Tips** - Short, actionable development tips
- **Project Showcases** - Walkthroughs of projects I'm working on

## Tech Stack

This blog is built with a modern tech stack that prioritizes developer experience and performance:

```typescript
const techStack = {
  framework: "Next.js 15",
  content: "MDX",
  styling: "Tailwind CSS",
  hosting: "Vercel",
  features: [
    "Server Components",
    "App Router",
    "Static Generation",
    "Dark Mode",
  ],
};
```

### Why Next.js?

Next.js provides an excellent foundation for content-focused websites. With the App Router and React Server Components, we get:

1. **Fast initial page loads** - Server-rendered HTML
2. **Seamless navigation** - Client-side routing after hydration
3. **Excellent SEO** - Static generation with dynamic metadata
4. **Developer experience** - Hot reloading, TypeScript support, and more

<Callout type="info">
All code examples in this blog are syntax highlighted using Shiki with the GitHub Dark theme.
</Callout>

## Code Examples

Here's a quick example of a React component:

```tsx
interface ButtonProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick?: () => void;
  variant?: "primary" | "secondary";
}

export function Button({ children, onClick, variant = "primary" }: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      className={`px-4 py-2 rounded-md ${
        variant === "primary"
          ? "bg-blue-500 text-white"
          : "bg-gray-200 text-gray-800"
      }`}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

And here's some Python for variety:

```python
def fibonacci(n: int) -> list[int]:
    """Generate the first n Fibonacci numbers."""
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    if n == 1:
        return [0]

    sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(sequence) < n:
        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])

    return sequence

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for more content! I have several posts planned covering:

- Building a modern blog with Next.js and MDX
- iOS development with SwiftUI
- AI and machine learning integrations
- Developer productivity tips

Feel free to explore the blog and check out the [Tags](/tags) page to find content by topic.

## Formatting Showcase

This section demonstrates the various formatting options available in MDX blog posts.

### Text Formatting

Regular paragraph text looks like this. You can make text **bold** or *italic* or ***both bold and italic***. You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ for deleted content. Inline `code` appears with a distinct background.

Here's another paragraph to show spacing between paragraphs. Good typography requires proper breathing room between blocks of text. This helps readability and makes the content feel less cramped.

### Blockquotes

> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it."
> — Alan Kay

Blockquotes can also span multiple paragraphs:

> This is the first paragraph of a longer quote.
>
> And this is the second paragraph. Notice how the quote mark continues on the left edge.

### Lists

#### Unordered Lists

- First item in an unordered list
- Second item with some more text to show wrapping behavior when the line gets long enough to wrap to the next line
- Third item
  - Nested item one
  - Nested item two
    - Even deeper nesting
    - Another deep item
  - Back to second level
- Fourth item at root level

#### Ordered Lists

1. First step in a process
2. Second step with detailed explanation that might span multiple lines to demonstrate how numbered lists handle longer content
3. Third step
   1. Sub-step A
   2. Sub-step B
   3. Sub-step C
4. Fourth step
5. Fifth step

#### Task Lists

- [x] Set up Next.js project
- [x] Configure MDX support
- [x] Add syntax highlighting
- [ ] Write more blog posts
- [ ] Add search functionality
- [ ] Implement comments

#### Mixed Lists

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Define requirements
   - Create wireframes
   - Review with stakeholders

2. **Development Phase**
   - Set up project structure
   - Implement core features
   - Write tests

3. **Deployment Phase**
   - Configure CI/CD
   - Deploy to staging
   - Final review and production release

### Headings Hierarchy

The following demonstrates all heading levels:

## Heading Level 2 (H2)

This is content under an H2 heading.

### Heading Level 3 (H3)

This is content under an H3 heading.

#### Heading Level 4 (H4)

This is content under an H4 heading. H4s are useful for subsections within H3s.

##### Heading Level 5 (H5)

Content under H5 - less commonly used but available when needed.

###### Heading Level 6 (H6)

The smallest heading level. Rarely used but sometimes helpful for fine-grained organization.

### Tables

| Feature | Status | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Blog posts | Complete | High |
| Tags | Complete | High |
| RSS Feed | Complete | Medium |
| Search | Planned | Medium |
| Comments | Planned | Low |

Tables can also have alignment:

| Left Aligned | Center Aligned | Right Aligned |
|:-------------|:--------------:|--------------:|
| Text | Text | Text |
| More | More | More |
| Data | Data | 123.45 |

### Links

Here's an [inline link](https://nextjs.org) to the Next.js website. You can also use [links with titles](https://nextjs.org "Next.js Homepage") that show tooltips on hover.

External links: [GitHub](https://github.com), [Vercel](https://vercel.com), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

Internal links: [Home](/), [Blog](/blog), [Tags](/tags)

### Horizontal Rules

Use horizontal rules to separate major sections:

---

Content after the rule.

---

Another section after another rule.

### More Code Examples

Here's a shell command:

```bash
npm install @next/mdx remark-gfm rehype-pretty-code
```

A JSON configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "my-blog",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```

CSS styling:

```css
.prose {
  max-width: 65ch;
  color: var(--foreground);
}

.prose h2 {
  margin-top: 2em;
  margin-bottom: 1em;
  font-weight: 700;
}
```

SQL query:

```sql
SELECT posts.title, posts.published_at, authors.name
FROM posts
INNER JOIN authors ON posts.author_id = authors.id
WHERE posts.draft = false
ORDER BY posts.published_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Swift code:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var count = 0

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Count: \(count)")
                .font(.largeTitle)

            Button("Increment") {
                count += 1
            }
            .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
This is an informational callout. It's useful for providing additional context or background information that supplements the main content.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
Warning callouts draw attention to potential issues or things the reader should be careful about.

## Wrapping Up

That covers the main formatting options available in this blog. MDX makes it easy to combine Markdown with React components for rich, interactive content.

Thanks for reading!
