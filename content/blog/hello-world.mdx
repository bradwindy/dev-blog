Welcome to my developer blog! This is where I'll share my thoughts on software development, tutorials, and more.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Tutorials** - Step-by-step guides on various technologies
- **Deep Dives** - In-depth exploration of technical topics
- **Quick Tips** - Short, actionable development tips
- **Project Showcases** - Walkthroughs of projects I'm working on

## Tech Stack

This blog is built with a modern tech stack that prioritizes developer experience and performance:

```typescript
const techStack = {
  framework: "Next.js 15",
  content: "MDX",
  styling: "Tailwind CSS",
  hosting: "Vercel",
  features: [
    "Server Components",
    "App Router",
    "Static Generation",
    "Dark Mode",
  ],
};
```

### Why Next.js?

Next.js provides an excellent foundation for content-focused websites. With the App Router and React Server Components, we get:

1. **Fast initial page loads** - Server-rendered HTML
2. **Seamless navigation** - Client-side routing after hydration
3. **Excellent SEO** - Static generation with dynamic metadata
4. **Developer experience** - Hot reloading, TypeScript support, and more

## Code Examples

Here's a quick example of a React component:

```tsx
interface ButtonProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick?: () => void;
  variant?: "primary" | "secondary";
}

export function Button({ children, onClick, variant = "primary" }: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      className={`px-4 py-2 rounded-md ${
        variant === "primary"
          ? "bg-blue-500 text-white"
          : "bg-gray-200 text-gray-800"
      }`}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

And here's some Python for variety:

```python
def fibonacci(n: int) -> list[int]:
    """Generate the first n Fibonacci numbers."""
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    if n == 1:
        return [0]

    sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(sequence) < n:
        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])

    return sequence

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for more content! I have several posts planned covering:

- Building a modern blog with Next.js and MDX
- iOS development with SwiftUI
- AI and machine learning integrations
- Developer productivity tips
